Our survey discusses major challenges in CL and current methods applied in neural network models. We also provide a critical review of the existing CL evaluation methods and datasets in NLP. Finally, we present our outlook on the future research directions.","tags":["COLING","Continual Learning"],"title":"Continual Lifelong Learning in Natural Language Processing: A Survey","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katarzyna Biesialska","Magdalena Biesialska","Henryk Rybiński"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600300800,"objectID":"cb6c253e87b8cbf5efce0972558d9b28","permalink":"https://mbiesialska.github.io/publication/ismis2020-sa/","publishdate":"2020-09-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ismis2020-sa/","section":"publication","summary":"Nominated for Best Paper Award (top 6,97% of accepted regular papers).","tags":["Sentiment Analysis","ISMIS"],"title":"Sentiment Analysis with Contextual Embeddings and Self-attention","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Magdalena Biesialska","Marta R.
