However, this scenario is very challenging as the general limitations of machine learning methods apply to neural network-based models. Contemporary neural networks learn in isolation, and are not able to effectively learn new information without forgetting previously acquired knowledge.

This is mainly caused by the fact that creating parallel corpora requires a great amount of resources (e.g. data, knowledge, time, money). Therefore, research on unsupervised MT focuses on eliminating the dependency on labeled data, which is especially beneficial for low-resource languages.
